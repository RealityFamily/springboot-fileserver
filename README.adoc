= springboot-fileserver

REST-style File Server being realized with Java and Spring Boot.

# Goals

1. Personal Reference Project for Spring Boot
1. Backend to upcoming Personal Text Management System

# Status (Pre-Alpha)

* No installable build, no run-time configuration
* Serving all files from a pre configured directory.
* Simple explorer-like navigation into document roots ("boxes" and their sub-directories to support interactive testing

## Test / Development
* Maybe change document root in `application.properties`
** Defaults to single root `src/test/resources/box`
* Start using Application class (or `buildnrun.sh`
* Point your browser to `http://localhost:8080`

# Future

## Next Steps

* Serving correct mimetype-header using Apache Tika
* Serving metadata in HTML header (last update, e.g.)
* Automatic conversion from Markdown to HTML
* Automatic conversion from Asciidoctor to HTML
* License selection
* Multiple content root directories
* Unit-Test for Error Handler

## Later
* Update existing and create new files
* Automatic Version Control using git
* Full text search using Lucene
* Support tags and filtering
* ...
