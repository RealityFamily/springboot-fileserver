= springboot-fileserver

REST-style File Server being realized with Java and Spring Boot.

# Goals

1. Personal Reference Project for Spring Boot
1. Backend for upcoming Personal Text Management System

# Status (Pre-Alpha)

* No installable build, no run-time configuration
* Serving all files from configurable directories.
* Simple explorer-like navigation into document roots ("boxes" and their sub-directories to support interactive testing
* Mime-type detection using Apache Tika
* Http-Header for file-based metadata
* Automatic rendering from Markdown and Asciidoctor to HTML

## Test / Development
* Configure document roots in `application.yml`
** Defaults to roots `demo` and `doc` below `src/test/resources`
* Start using `Application.class`, `mvn spring-boot:run` or `buildnrun.sh`)
* Point your browser to `http://localhost:8001`

# Future

## Milestone 1 (Read Only, Plain Text, Markup Rendering)
* Serving text files with mimetype and file-based metadata
* Automatic rendering of markdown and asciidoctor to html
* Maybe specific support for some other textual content, `csv` e. g.
* Experimental: Full text search

## Milestone 2 (Binary files)
* Documents, Music, Images, Videos
* Content-based metadata (id3, exif, ...)
* Streaming large files

## Milestone 3 (Create/Update/Delete, Version History)
* Create new files, update or delete existing files
* Experimental: Automatic Version Control using git
